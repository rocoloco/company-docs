```bash
# Claude Code will automatically read CLAUDE.md for development standards
claude-code --context ./company-docs "Review PRD for technical inconsistencies"
claude-code --context ./mobius-api "Implement user authentication with TDD"
claude-code --context ./ "Update investor deck with latest metrics"
```

**Development Context**: See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete development standards including TDD, TypeScript guidelines, and performance requirements.
