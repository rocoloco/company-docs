# Architecture Decision Record

## ADR-001: Integration Strategy - Merge.dev Partnership

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Author(s)**: CTO, VP Engineering  
**Deciders**: CTO, VP Engineering, CEO, VP Product  

## Context

Mobius One needs to integrate with 170+ enterprise systems to provide comprehensive business intelligence. Building and maintaining individual integrations for each system would require:
- 2-3 engineering months per integration
- Ongoing maintenance for API changes
- Managing different authentication methods
- Handling rate limits and quotas
- Dealing with pagination and data formats

This would require a team of 20+ engineers focused solely on integrations, delaying our core product development and time to market.

## Decision

We will partner with Merge.dev as our primary integration provider, leveraging their unified API to access 170+ enterprise systems through a single interface.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Build All Integrations In-House
- **Description**: Develop and maintain all integrations internally
- **Pros**:
  - Complete control over integration features
  - No external dependencies
  - Potential competitive advantage
  - Custom optimization possible
- **Cons**:
  - 300+ engineering months required
  - Ongoing maintenance burden
  - Delayed time to market
  - Distraction from core product

### Option 2: Partner with Merge.dev
- **Description**: Use Merge.dev's unified API for all integrations
- **Pros**:
  - 170+ integrations available immediately
  - Single API to maintain
  - Automatic updates for API changes
  - Proven enterprise-grade reliability
  - Focus on core product development
- **Cons**:
  - Dependency on third-party service
  - Per-connection pricing
  - Less control over integration features
  - Potential rate limit constraints

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Description**: Use Merge.dev for common integrations, build critical ones in-house
- **Pros**:
  - Balance of control and speed
  - Optimize critical integrations
  - Reduce some dependencies
- **Cons**:
  - Complex architecture
  - Still significant engineering effort
  - Inconsistent integration experiences
  - Higher operational complexity

### Option 4: Multiple Integration Providers
- **Description**: Use different providers for different categories (e.g., Merge for CRM, Finch for HRIS)
- **Pros**:
  - Best-in-class for each category
  - Redundancy in providers
  - Specialized features
- **Cons**:
  - Multiple APIs to manage
  - Inconsistent data models
  - Complex error handling
  - Higher total costs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Immediate access to 170+ integrations
- 10x faster time to market
- Engineering team can focus on core AI/ML features
- Predictable integration quality and uptime
- Automatic handling of API changes
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

### Negative
- Dependency on external vendor
- Per-connection costs impact unit economics
- Less control over integration roadmap
- Potential rate limiting issues at scale
- Need contingency plan if Merge.dev fails

### Neutral
- Need to build abstraction layer over Merge.dev API
- Require monitoring of Merge.dev performance
- Must maintain good vendor relationship

## Implementation Notes

### Integration Architecture
```typescript
// Abstract integration interface
interface IntegrationProvider {
  connect(config: ConnectionConfig): Promise<Connection>;
  fetchData(connection: Connection, query: Query): Promise<Data>;
  syncData(connection: Connection): Promise<SyncResult>;
}

// Merge.dev implementation
class MergeIntegrationProvider implements IntegrationProvider {
  private mergeClient: MergeClient;
  
  async connect(config: ConnectionConfig): Promise<Connection> {
    // Implement Merge.dev connection flow
  }
  
  async fetchData(connection: Connection, query: Query): Promise<Data> {
    // Transform our query to Merge.dev API call
  }
}

// Future-proof with provider abstraction
class IntegrationService {
  constructor(private provider: IntegrationProvider) {}
  
  // All integration logic uses provider interface
}
```

### Contingency Planning
1. Build abstraction layer to enable provider switching
2. Implement caching to reduce API calls
3. Monitor Merge.dev SLA compliance
4. Maintain list of critical integrations to build if needed
5. Regular data exports for business continuity

### Cost Optimization
1. Implement intelligent caching layer
2. Batch API requests where possible
3. Use webhooks instead of polling
4. Monitor per-connection costs
5. Negotiate volume discounts
