## Making Decisions

When facing difficult decisions, we ask:
1. Does this serve our users' success?
2. Does this align with our values?
3. Would we be proud if this was public?
4. Does this build long-term trust?
5. Is this the simple solution?

If the answer to any is "no," we reconsider.

## Measuring Success

We know we're living our values when:
- Customer NPS exceeds 70
- Employee satisfaction exceeds 90%
- Query response time stays under 500ms
- User training requests approach zero
- Revenue retention exceeds 120%

## The Mobius One Way

The Mobius One Way is the synthesis of our vision, mission, and values into daily action. It means:
- Starting every day thinking about user success
- Making decisions quickly with user impact in mind
- Building simple, fast, transparent solutions
- Taking ownership and accepting accountability
- Constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible

When in doubt, we ask: "What would be best for Sarah (our CFO persona)?" The answer usually becomes clear.
