# **Mobius 1: Multi-Channel Payment Reconciliation Platform**

## **Business Plan 2025**

### **Version 6.0: Focused Strategy with Private Intelligence Evolution**

-----

## **Executive Summary**

SMBs waste 60 hours monthly reconciling payments from multiple channels. We automate this entire process, saving $3,000 in labor costs monthly. Our platform reconciles Stripe, Amazon, and Shopify payments in 5 minutes.

### **Company Overview**

Mobius automates payment reconciliation for SMBs, reducing 60 hours of monthly work to a 5-minute process. We automatically match bank deposits to payment processor payouts (Stripe, Amazon, Shopify) and sync clean data to QuickBooks with fees properly separated. During reconciliation, we flag discrepancies for investigation.

### **The Validated Problem**

**PwC research documents the reconciliation burden:**

- SMBs with **1,000 transactions/month spend 60 hours** on reconciliation
- SMBs with **10,000 transactions/month spend 200 hours** on reconciliation
- Multi-channel e-commerce adds exponential complexity
- Manual reconciliation has 0.8-1.8% error rate, adding 8-30 hours of rework

### **Our Solution: Multi-Channel Payment Reconciliation**

Mobius 1 unifies reconciliation across all payment channels:

1. **Pulls bank deposits** via Plaid (read-only, secure)
2. **Matches deposits** to Stripe/Amazon/Shopify payouts automatically
3. **Breaks down payouts** into individual transactions
4. **Syncs to QuickBooks** with fees properly separated
5. **Flags discrepancies** for investigation

**Result:** 5-minute reconciliation process saving 60 hours monthly

### **Market Opportunity**

The payment reconciliation market for SMBs shows significant gaps:

- **55,000 SMBs** fall between QuickBooks basic features and enterprise solutions
- **$330M addressable market** (55,000 × $6,000 annual value at new pricing)
- **60-200 hours monthly** spent on manual reconciliation (PwC data)
- **Growing complexity:** Payment channel proliferation continues
- **Market validation:** Ledge.io's NEA funding and Papaya Global deployment proves demand

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **Multi-channel unification** - Single platform for all payment processors
- **Fixed monthly pricing** - No percentage-based fees, transparent costs
- **Automated matching** - No manual "click to match" required
- **SMB-focused** - Built for businesses doing $3-10M, not Fortune 500
- **5-minute setup** - vs weeks of implementation for enterprise tools

### **Financial Projections (Realistic)**

- **Current:** Pre-launch, beta testing with 10 prospects
- **January 2026:** 5 customers, $1.5K MRR
- **April 2026:** 40 customers, $12K MRR
- **December 2026:** 150 customers, $55K MRR
- **December 2027:** 800 customers, $360K MRR
- **December 2028:** 2,500 customers, $1.4M MRR

### **Funding Requirements**

Seeking $1.5M seed round (Q4 2026) after proving product-market fit with 150 customers. Focus on extending runway and controlled growth rather than aggressive scaling.

-----

## **Problem Validation: Research Evidence**

### **Quantified Time Investment (PwC Research)**

PwC's 2024 research on manual bookkeeping provides specific data on reconciliation time:

**Time by Transaction Volume:**

- **100 transactions/month:** 20 hours of reconciliation
- **1,000 transactions/month:** 60 hours of reconciliation
- **10,000 transactions/month:** 200 hours of reconciliation

**Documented Business Cases:**

- **MDM Props:** Saved 32 hours weekly (128+ hours monthly) on card reconciliation after automation
- **UCCU Credit Union:** Reduced Federal Reserve account reconciliation from 6 hours to 30 minutes daily
- **Embrace Manufacturing:** Cut reconciliation time from 2 weeks to 2 days across 150 accounts
- **Papaya Global:** Achieved 90% reduction in reconciliation time using Ledge.io (validates market demand)

### **Multi-Channel Complexity Factors**

**Payment Processor Timing Variations:**

- **Stripe:** 2-7 day payout speeds depending on account settings
- **Amazon:** Variable settlement timing with reserve holds
- **Shopify:** Different payout speeds by payment gateway and country
- **Result:** Deposit timing never aligns with transaction dates

**Webgility Research:**

- Brands lose 20 hours weekly reconciling multi-channel data
- 47% cite fragmented data systems as primary reconciliation barrier

### **Current Solution Limitations**

**A2X/Synder:** Handle single channels, still require manual bank matching in QuickBooks
**Ledge.io:** Enterprise-focused with AI black box, weeks of implementation, opaque pricing
**BlackLine:** $6,400/month minimum, designed for enterprise complexity SMBs don't have
**QuickBooks Native:** Cannot automatically match deposits to payment processor payouts
**Manual Process:** Excel with 0.8-1.8% error rate, no audit trail

-----

## **Solution Design**

### **Value Proposition**

**"Multi-channel payment reconciliation that saves 60 hours monthly"**

We connect all your payment channels and automate the entire reconciliation process. A2X handles single channels. Ledge.io requires enterprise implementation. BlackLine costs $6,400/month. We connect everything for $297-997/month with 5-minute setup.

### **User Experience Flow**

```
Setup (5 minutes total):
1. Connect bank account via Plaid (2 minutes)
2. Connect Stripe (1 minute)
3. Connect QuickBooks (1 minute)

Monthly reconciliation (5 minutes):
1. Click "Reconcile [Month]"
2. Review matched deposits (auto-matched at 95% accuracy)
3. Confirm edge cases
4. Sync to QuickBooks

Output:
- Matched deposits with full transaction detail
- Separated fees and adjustments
- Complete audit trail
- Flagged discrepancies for review
```

### **ROI Calculation**

For a business with 1,000 monthly transactions:

**Time Savings:**

- Manual process: 60 hours/month (PwC data)
- With Mobius 1: 0.25 hours/month
- Time saved: 59.75 hours × $50/hour = **$2,987.50**

**Total Value Created: $2,987.50/month**
**Mobius 1 Cost: $397/month**
**ROI: 7.5x**

### **Technical Approach: Hybrid Matching Architecture**

Our matching engine uses a sophisticated 4-stage pipeline:

1. **SQL Pattern Matching** - Handles 80% of standard cases
2. **Vector Embeddings** - Semantic matching for complex descriptions
3. **ML Scoring** - Confidence scoring based on historical patterns
4. **Quality Assurance** - Human review for low-confidence matches

This complex backend delivers simple "5-minute reconciliation" to users - unlike Ledge's AI black box approach.

## **Strategic Evolution: Private Financial Intelligence (Month 6+)**

### **Market Insight**

The enterprise AI adoption crisis revealed in 2025: companies know they're feeding competitive advantages to AI vendors but are paralyzed about alternatives. This creates a massive opportunity for "Private Intelligence" platforms.

### **Mobius 1's Unique Position**

- Already processing financial data locally (no external AI APIs)
- Custom ML pipeline learns from patterns without sharing
- Infrastructure designed for data sovereignty by default

- Execute current plan: 150 customers by Dec 2026
- Prove core value proposition
- Build trust with SMBs

**Phase 2 (Month 6): Intelligent Isolation**

- Add customer-specific encryption for competitive patterns
- Launch "Professional" tier at $597 with data sovereignty
- Market as "Your patterns stay yours"

**Phase 3 (Month 12): Platform Expansion**

- Expand beyond reconciliation (expense categorization, fraud detection)
- White-label offerings for accounting firms
- API access for enterprise customers

### **Competitive Moat**

Unlike QuickBooks (shared learning), Ledge (AI black box), or BlackLine (enterprise complexity), Mobius 1 offers SMBs their own private financial intelligence that improves with their data alone.

### **Dual-Track Strategy**

**Track 1: Execution (Current Plan)**

- Launch with reconciliation
