# **Mobius One: Intelligent Payment Reconciliation Platform**

## **Business Plan 2025**

---

## **Executive Summary**

### **Company Overview**

Mobius One is a financial technology company that automates payment reconciliation between Stripe and QuickBooks for small and medium-sized SaaS businesses. Founded in 2025 and headquartered in Tampa, Florida, we solve a critical operational bottleneck that costs finance teams 20-30 hours weekly in manual reconciliation work.

### **Problem Statement**

Research indicates that finance departments spend 30-50% of their time on reconciliation tasks, with manual processing requiring 45-60 minutes per transaction. For SaaS companies processing hundreds of Stripe payments monthly, this translates to 15-30 hours of weekly manual work. Current solutions either require 6-12 month enterprise implementations or offer unreliable third-party integrations that fail to handle the complexity of payment processing fees, partial payments, and customer matching.

### **Solution**

Mobius One provides intelligent batch reconciliation that automatically matches Stripe transactions to QuickBooks invoices with 95%+ accuracy. Our platform imports and reconciles up to 5 years of historical data, then maintains synchronization through reliable polling-based updates every 15 minutes. Unlike webhook-based competitors, our approach prioritizes data completeness and accuracy over real-time updates, aligning with what finance teams actually need.

### **Market Opportunity**

The global payment reconciliation software market is valued at $3.2 billion and growing at 12.5% CAGR. Within this market, the Stripe-to-QuickBooks integration segment represents a $450 million opportunity, with over 50,000 potential customers in the United States alone who currently lack adequate solutions.

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **Historical Import**: Reconcile years of unmatched transactions in days, not months
- **Reliability-First Architecture**: Polling-based sync with 99.9% uptime vs. webhook failures
- **Fee Intelligence**: Automatic handling of Stripe's 2.9% + 30¢ fee structure
- **SMB-Focused**: 3-day implementation vs. 6-12 months for enterprise solutions
- **Transparent Pricing**: Published rates vs. "contact sales" models

### **Financial Highlights**

- **Year 1**: $285K revenue, 80 customers
- **Year 3**: $2.5M revenue, 600 customers, cash flow positive
- **Year 5**: $11.8M revenue, 2,200 customers, 35% EBITDA margin
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 8:1
- **Payback Period**: 5 months

### **Funding Request**

Seeking $2.5M Series A to accelerate product development, expand integrations, and scale customer acquisition. Expected 5x revenue multiple at Series B based on comparable SaaS metrics.
