# **Mobius 1: Bank Reconciliation That Pays For Itself**

## **Business Plan 2025**

-----

## **Executive Summary**

### **Company Overview**

Mobius automates bank reconciliation for SMBs, turning the monthly 20+ hour nightmare into a 5-minute process. We start with your bank statements, automatically match every deposit to its payment source (Stripe, Amazon, Shopify), and sync everything to QuickBooks. 

### **The Problem**

SMB finance teams waste **20-30 hours monthly** manually reconciling bank deposits to payment processors. The process involves seven painful steps: downloading reports, matching transactions, separating fees, investigating discrepancies, creating adjustments, maintaining audit trails, and performing month-end verification.

**The hidden truth:** During this manual process, they’re missing thousands in recoverable fees, but they’re too exhausted from reconciliation to pursue them.

### **Our Solution: Bank-First Reconciliation**

Mobius flips the traditional approach. Instead of starting with payment processors, we start with your bank, where the money actually is. Our platform:

1. **Pulls bank deposits** via Plaid (read-only, secure)
1. **Matches deposits** to Stripe/Amazon/Shopify payouts automatically
1. **Breaks down payouts** into individual transactions
1. **Syncs to QuickBooks** with fees properly separated
1. **Finds recoverable money** as a delightful bonus

**Result:** 5-minute reconciliation

### **Market Opportunity**

The bank reconciliation market is massive and underserved:

- **55,000 SMBs** stuck between QuickBooks and BlackLine
- **$460M immediate TAM** (55,000 × $8,364 annual value)
- **20-30 hours monthly** wasted on manual reconciliation
- **Growing urgency:** Payment complexity increasing yearly

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **Reconciliation tool that finds money** - Others just match transactions
- **Bank-first approach** - Start where CFOs actually start (bank statements)
- **Predictable pricing** - No percentage fees that SMBs hate
- **Network intelligence** - Every reconciliation teaches our system new patterns

### **Financial Projections (Revised)**

- **Current:** 0 customers (launching September 2025)
- **March 2025:** 50 customers, $100K MRR
- **December 2026:** 500 customers
- **December 2027:** 2,000 customers

-----

## **Problem Validation**

### **The 20-Hour Reality**

Independent research reveals the true scope of reconciliation pain:

- **Small businesses:** 6-10 hours weekly on reconciliation
- **Medium businesses:** 10-20 hours weekly
- **High-transaction businesses:** 20+ hours weekly
- **UK payment industry data:** 1,300 hours annually just on data prep

**One QuickBooks user’s testimony:** “5,000 Stripe transactions for the year… this is not a workable solution.”

### **The Seven Circles of Reconciliation Hell**

Manual reconciliation isn’t just matching—it’s a seven-step nightmare:

1. **Download reports** from multiple systems
1. **Match transactions** one by one
1. **Separate gross from fees** for proper categorization
1. **Investigate discrepancies** between expected and actual
1. **Create adjustment entries** for differences
1. **Maintain audit trails** for compliance
1. **Perform month-end verification** and close

**Each step compounds complexity.** Miss one transaction in step 2, and you’re hunting for it in step 7.

### **Why Existing Solutions Fail**

**QuickBooks alone:** Can’t handle multi-channel complexity
**Excel:** Creates 0.8-1.8% error rate, no audit trail
**BlackLine:** $6,400/month minimum, enterprise-only
**Webhooks:** Fail silently, miss transactions, require polling anyway
**Point solutions:** Need different tool for each payment processor

-----

## **Solution Architecture**

### **The Bank-First Revolution**

Traditional approach (broken):

```
Payment Processor → Transaction List → Try to Match → QuickBooks
```

Mobius approach (works):

```
Bank Statement → Find Deposits → Match to Payouts → Breakdown → QuickBooks
```

### **Core Product Flow**

```typescript
// What users experience: Pure simplicity
Step 1: Connect bank via Plaid (2 minutes)
Step 2: Connect Stripe/Amazon/Shopify (1 minute each)
Step 3: Connect QuickBooks (1 minute)
Step 4: Click "Reconcile March" (5 minutes to complete)

// What happens behind the scenes: Sophisticated matching
1. Pull all bank deposits for the month
2. Identify payment processor deposits
3. Match to specific payouts from Stripe/Amazon/Shopify
4. Break down payouts into component transactions
5. Separate fees, refunds, adjustments
6. Create QuickBooks entries with proper categorization
7. Flag unmatched items for review
8. Scan for recoverable fees (bonus feature)
```

### **Why Polling Beats Webhooks**

**Industry evidence:**

- Stripe itself uses daily settlement files for financial reconciliation
- Plaid moved FROM webhooks TO polling after reliability issues
- Major banks use batch processing, not real-time
- Webhooks fail silently; polling fails loudly

**Our architecture:**

- Poll every 4 hours for new payouts
- Daily complete reconciliation at 2 AM
- Monthly deep reconciliation with full audit trail
- No missed transactions, ever

### **The Hidden Intelligence Layer**

While users see simple reconciliation, our system learns:

- Matching patterns across 50,000+ transactions
- Fee structures across payment processors
- Common error patterns by industry
- Recovery opportunities other customers found

**Every customer makes the system smarter for everyone.**

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Technology Stack**

- **Backend:** Node.js/TypeScript (proven for financial systems)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (transactions) + Redis (caching)
- **Queue:** Bull/Redis (reliable job processing)
- **APIs:** Plaid (banks), Stripe, QuickBooks, Amazon SP-API

### **Why Polling > Webhooks (Technical Proof)**

```typescript
// Webhook architecture (unreliable)
Webhook arrives → Must respond in 20 seconds → Queue for processing → 
Process later → Hope queue doesn't fail → Handle out-of-order arrival → 
Implement recovery for missed webhooks → End up polling anyway

// Polling architecture (bulletproof)
Every 4 hours → Request all new transactions → Process in order → 
Know exactly what you have → Never miss anything
```

**Evidence:** Stripe, Plaid, and every major bank use batch reconciliation for actual financial records, not webhooks.

### **Development Timeline**

**Weeks 1-2:** Bank integration via Plaid
**Weeks 3-4:** Stripe payout matching
**Weeks 5-6:** QuickBooks sync
**Weeks 7-8:** UI and launch prep
**Month 3:** Amazon integration
**Month 4:** Shopify integration

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Addressed Risks**

|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**“Nobody searches for reconciliation”**|They do - 10K+ monthly searches for “Stripe QuickBooks reconciliation”|
|**“Webhooks are the future”**           |Evidence shows polling is more reliable for financial data            |
|**“Can’t compete with free tools”**     |Free tools don’t start from bank or find money                        |
|**“Plaid is expensive”**                |$0.30 per connection, paid by massive time savings                    |

### **Remaining Risks**

|-------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
|**QuickBooks API limits**|Medium|Batch operations, smart caching         |
|**Customer churn**       |High  |Strong onboarding, clear value in week 1|
|**Competition copies**   |Medium|Network effects create moat             |

Start with reconciliation, add recovery, expand to AP/AR, become full financial automation.

### **Technical Simplicity**

Polling is 10x simpler than webhooks, ships faster, works better.

### **Market Timing**

**The hidden truth:** By starting with the boring problem (reconciliation) and making it magical, we build trust to solve bigger problems later.

-----

## **Call to Action**

Every SMB wastes 20+ hours monthly on reconciliation. We give them their time back in 5 minutes, plus find money they didn’t know existed.

While competitors chase webhooks and complex AI, we’re building the simple, bulletproof solution that actually works.

**The opportunity:** $460M market that nobody’s serving correctly.
**The solution:** Bank-first reconciliation that pays for itself.
**The result:** The most loved financial tool for SMBs.
