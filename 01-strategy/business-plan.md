# **Mobius: Multi-Channel Payment Reconciliation Platform**

## **Business Plan 2025**

### **Mid-Year Strategic Update**

-----

## **Executive Summary**

### **Company Overview**

Mobius is a financial technology company that automates payment reconciliation across multiple channels (Stripe, Amazon, Shopify) into QuickBooks for the 55,000 companies trapped between basic accounting tools and enterprise solutions. Founded in 2025 and headquartered in Tampa, Florida, we solve the critical operational bottleneck where 84% of companies still rely on manual Excel reconciliation despite having software, losing 3-5% of revenue to reconciliation errors.

### **Problem Statement**

Recent market research reveals that the average e-commerce business uses 3.2 payment processors but reconciles them in silos, spending 20+ hours weekly on manual reconciliation. The “missing middle” market - companies with 50-250 employees processing 150-5,000 monthly transactions - faces an impossible choice: QuickBooks can’t handle their complexity ($27.50/month), while enterprise solutions like BlackLine cost $77,000/year with 4.5-month implementations.

### **Solution**

Mobius provides intelligent multi-channel reconciliation that automatically matches transactions from Stripe, Amazon, and Shopify to QuickBooks invoices with 95%+ accuracy. Our platform imports up to 5 years of historical data, maintains real-time synchronization through webhooks, and uses AI-assisted verification that shows exactly why each match was made - not just a confidence score.

### **Market Opportunity**

The global payment reconciliation software market is valued at $3.2 billion, growing at 12.5% CAGR. Within this, our specific opportunity includes:

- **Missing Middle Market**: 55,000 companies × $6,000/year = $330M
- **E-commerce Multi-Channel**: $500M+ (preventing 3-5% revenue leakage)
- **Real-Time Payments**: $37 trillion in traditional payments shifting to instant by 2028

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **Start Simple, Expand Naturally**: Begin with Stripe, add channels as customers grow
- **Multi-Channel Unification**: Only solution reconciling Stripe + Amazon + Shopify in one platform
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant webhook updates vs. competitors’ batch processing
- **PCI Out-of-Scope**: Never touch card data, eliminating compliance costs
- **5-Minute Setup**: No consultants or 4.5-month implementations

### **Financial Highlights (Revised August 2025)**

- **Current**: ~$15K MRR, ~50 customers
- **Year-End 2025**: $350K MRR, 500 customers, multi-channel live
- **2026 Target**: $1.5M MRR, 2,000 customers, cash flow positive
- **2027 Target**: $5M MRR, 5,000 customers, 30% EBITDA margin
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 8:1
- **Payback Period**: 5 months

### **Funding Request**

Seeking $3M Series A (Q1 2026) to accelerate multi-channel development, scale customer acquisition, and expand to 10 payment platforms. Expected 10x revenue multiple at Series B based on multi-channel SaaS comparables.

## **Market Analysis**

### **Industry Overview - The Multi-Channel Crisis**

The payment reconciliation market has reached an inflection point in 2025:
