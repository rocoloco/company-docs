# **Mobius 1: Revenue Recovery Platform**

## **Business Plan 2025**

### **Mid-Year Strategic Update**

-----

## **Executive Summary**

### **Company Overview**

Mobius 1 is a financial technology company that helps businesses recover the 3-5% of revenue they’re losing through payment blind spots. We don’t just reconcile payments—we find hidden fees, failed payments, duplicate charges, and fraud across Stripe, Amazon, and Shopify. Founded in 2025 and headquartered in Tampa, Florida, we’ve discovered that 84% of companies using manual reconciliation are bleeding money they don’t even know about.

### **Problem Statement**

Our research reveals a brutal truth: businesses lose 3-5% of revenue through financial blind spots, but think it’s just “the cost of doing business.” The average e-commerce company loses money to:

- **0.8-1.8%** from reconciliation errors alone
- **3.4%** from payment fraud they don’t catch
- **5-9%** from failed payments never recovered (SaaS)
- **$101B annually** from return fraud (retail)
- **15+ hidden fee types** on Amazon settlements

The “missing middle” market—55,000 companies between QuickBooks and BlackLine—loses **5-7 full days monthly** searching for discrepancies after the money is already gone.

### **Solution**

Mobius 1 is a revenue recovery platform that automatically finds and recovers lost money across all payment channels. We scan historical transactions (up to 5 years), identify overcharges and errors, file recovery claims automatically, and prevent future losses through real-time monitoring. Our platform has already found an average of **$47,000 per customer** in year one.

### **Market Opportunity**

The global payment reconciliation market ($3.2B) is really a revenue recovery opportunity:

- **Immediate Addressable Market**: 55,000 companies × $47,000 average recovery = **$2.6B in recoverable revenue**
- **Our Revenue Opportunity**: $8,364 average customer value × 55,000 = **$460M potential**
- **Expansion Market**: 500,000+ multi-channel businesses globally
- **Growing Problem**: E-commerce fraud alone reaching $100B by 2029

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **We Find Money, Others Find Matches**: Only platform focused on revenue recovery vs. reconciliation
- **SMB-Friendly Pricing**: Predictable monthly tiers, no percentage fees that SMBs hate
- **Network Intelligence**: Every pattern we find for one customer helps all customers
- **Immediate ROI**: Average customer sees money recovered in first 7 days
- **No Risk**: 30-day money-back guarantee if we don’t find 3x the subscription cost

### **Financial Highlights (Revised August 2025)**

- **Current**: ~$15K MRR, ~50 customers, ~$75K recovered for customers
- **Year-End 2025**: $350K MRR, 500 customers, $10M+ recovered
- **2026 Target**: $1.7M MRR, 2,000 customers, $100M recovered
- **2027 Target**: $5M MRR, 6,000 customers, $500M recovered
- **Customer Economics**: $500 CAC, $697 average monthly price
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 7:1 (36-month LTV of $3,500)
- **Payback Period**: <1 month

### **Funding Request**

Seeking $3M Series A (Q1 2026) to scale revenue recovery capabilities, expand to 10+ payment platforms, and build the intelligence network that makes finding money automatic. Expected 10x revenue multiple at Series B based on network effects and 85% gross margins.

## **Company Description**

### **Mission Statement**

To turn every business’s financial blind spots into recovered revenue, ensuring no dollar is lost to payment complexity.

### **Vision Statement**

### **Company History and Current Status**

Mobius 1 was founded in January 2025 when our founding team discovered their previous e-commerce company had been overcharged $180,000 in Amazon fees over two years. After recovering the money, they realized every multi-channel business faces the same problem—but SMBs can’t afford enterprise solutions or tolerate percentage-based pricing.

- Revenue recovery engine operational for Stripe
- 50 beta customers averaging $1,500 in monthly recoveries
- Testing predictable pricing tiers that SMBs love
- 4 months to capture market before competition adapts

## **Market Analysis**

### **Industry Overview - The Hidden Revenue Crisis**

The payment landscape in 2025 has created a perfect storm of revenue leakage:

- **Multi-Channel Chaos**: Average business uses 3.2 payment processors, each hiding different fees
- **Manual Blindness**: 84% still use Excel, creating 0.8-1.8% error rates
- **Fraud Explosion**: E-commerce fraud hitting $44.3B globally, growing to $100B by 2029
- **SMB Pricing Sensitivity**: 50%+ prefer month-to-month pricing, hate percentage fees
- **Budget Constraints**: 37% cite inflation as biggest challenge, cutting tech spend 25%

**The Real Insight**: SMBs know they’re losing money but need predictable costs to fix it. Percentage-based pricing is a non-starter—they already hate Stripe’s 2.9% fees.

### **Target Market (Refined)**

- **Pain Points**:
  - “We’re already paying Stripe 2.9%, not paying more percentages”
  - “Need predictable monthly costs for budgeting”
  - “Found out Amazon overcharged us for 2 years”
- **Budget Reality**: Will pay $300-1,500/month for clear value

  - “Need to reduce involuntary churn”
- **Budget Reality**: $500-1,500/month for tools that save MRR
- **Buying Trigger**: High involuntary churn, investor pressure on unit economics

#### **Tertiary Target: Amazon FBA Sellers** (Scale)

- **Company Profile**: Professional Amazon sellers
- **Size**: $1-10M revenue, 5-50 employees
- **Current Loss**: 2-3% in fee errors

  - “Settlement reports are incomprehensible”
  - “Margins getting crushed by fee increases”
- **Budget Reality**: $200-800/month maximum

## **Product & Pricing Strategy**

### **The Anti-Percentage Pricing Model**

Research shows SMBs despise percentage-based pricing because:

- **Budget Uncertainty**: Can’t predict monthly costs
- **Success Penalty**: Feel punished for growth
- **Fee Fatigue**: Already paying 2.9% to Stripe, 15% to Amazon
- **Trust Issues**: Percentage models feel like “giving away success”

### **Tiered Value Pricing (What SMBs Actually Want)**

#### **Starter - $299/month**

**“Find Your First $5,000 Every Month”**

- 1 payment channel (Stripe OR Amazon OR Shopify)
- Up to 1,000 transactions/month
- Fee audit & basic recovery
- Historical import (1 year)
- Email support
- **Target**: Small businesses testing the waters

- **Psychology**: Low-risk entry point

#### **Growth - $697/month** (Most Popular)

**“Find Up to $20,000 Every Month”**

- Up to 3 payment channels

1. **Transparent**: No hidden fees or percentages
1. **Value-Clear**: Know exactly what you get at each tier
1. **Growth-Friendly**: Upgrade when ready, not forced

### **Pricing Psychology Hacks**

- **“Recovery Credits”**: Frame tiers as “Find up to $X” not limits

- **Free Month**: “Get December free with annual plan”
- **Referral Bonus**: “Both get a month free” for referrals
- **Money-Back Guarantee**: 30 days if we don’t find 3x your subscription

### **Expansion Revenue Strategy**

Instead of percentage fees, drive expansion through:

1. **Volume Upgrades**: Move tiers as transaction volume grows
1. **Premium Features**: Advanced fraud detection, custom rules

## **Competitive Advantages**

### **The Anti-Percentage Position**

While everyone else charges percentages (Stripe 2.9%, Amazon 15%, recovery companies 10-20%), we’re the only platform with:

1. **Predictable SMB-friendly pricing**
1. **No success penalty** (pay same whether you recover $1K or $20K)
1. **Budget-able costs** for CFO approval
1. **Trust-building model** (we’re not taking a cut)

### **Network Effects at Scale**

- Every customer helps identify patterns
- Patterns help all customers recover more
- More recovery drives word-of-mouth
- Word-of-mouth lowers CAC
- Lower CAC allows competitive pricing

### **Capital Efficiency**

- **$500 CAC with <1 month payback** at Growth tier
- **85% gross margins** on subscription revenue
- **No revenue share** means predictable unit economics
- **Path to profitability** at just 1,000 customers
