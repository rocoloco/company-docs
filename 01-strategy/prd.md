# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Mobius: Automated Stripe-QuickBooks Reconciliation Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

Mobius eliminates the 15-20+ hours per week that businesses spend manually reconciling Stripe payments with QuickBooks invoices. By leveraging intelligent pattern matching, automated fee handling, and proven reconciliation workflows, Mobius delivers immediate time savings while maintaining the accuracy and audit trails required for financial compliance.

### Key Differentiators
- **80% faster implementation** than enterprise solutions (days vs. weeks)
- **Pattern learning** that improves accuracy over time (stolen from Ledge)
- **Fee intelligence** built-in from day one (addressing top user complaint)
- **Trust through transparency** with complete audit trails and confidence scoring
- **SMB-focused pricing** at $99-299/month vs. enterprise solutions at $1000+

---

## Problem Statement

### Validated Pain Points
1. **Time Investment**: Businesses spend 15-20+ hours weekly on manual Stripe-QuickBooks reconciliation (conservative estimate)
2. **Error-Prone Process**: Manual matching leads to 5-10% error rates on average
3. **Fee Handling Complexity**: Stripe's 2.9% + 30¢ fee structure requires manual calculation and separation
4. **Scaling Nightmare**: Time investment grows linearly with transaction volume
5. **Audit Risk**: Lack of proper reconciliation trails creates compliance vulnerabilities

### Current Solution Gaps
- **QuickBooks Bank Feed**: 48-72 hour delays, no automatic invoice matching
- **Zapier/Make/n8n**: Requires complex workflow maintenance, no reconciliation logic
- **Third-party apps**: Trust issues with financial data, poor fee handling, expensive

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 500,000+ businesses using both Stripe and QuickBooks
- **Pain Severity**: Users threatening to switch from QuickBooks due to lack of integration
- **Willingness to Pay**: Proven by Numeric ($38M raised), Ledge ($9M raised), profitable competitors

## Solution Overview

### Core Value Proposition
"Mobius automatically reconciles your Stripe payments with QuickBooks invoices in real-time, eliminating 95% of manual work while maintaining perfect audit trails."

### Technical Approach (Validated by Research)

#### Phase 1: Polling-Based Foundation (Not Webhooks)
Based on developer consensus and reliability requirements:
```
1. Scheduled polling every 15 minutes (configurable)
2. Batch processing for efficiency
3. Incremental sync to minimize API calls
4. Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
```

#### Phase 2: Intelligent Matching Engine
Incorporating Numeric and Ledge's proven approaches:
```
1. Exact amount matching (baseline)
2. Fee-adjusted matching (Stripe fees calculated automatically)
3. Customer email/name fuzzy matching
4. Date proximity scoring
5. Pattern learning from successful matches
6. Confidence scoring (0-100%)
```

#### Phase 3: Reconciliation Workflows
Based on SolveXia's 17-year success:
```
1. Auto-match high confidence (>95%)
2. Review queue for medium confidence (70-95%)
3. Exception handling for low confidence (<70%)
4. Manual override with learning
5. Bulk operations for efficiency
```

## Feature Requirements

### MVP (Weeks 1-4)

#### 1. Core Integration
**What We're Building:**
- OAuth connection to Stripe and QuickBooks
- Secure credential storage (encrypted at rest)
- Connection health monitoring
- Auto-refresh for token expiration

**Success Metrics:**
- Connection success rate > 99%
- Setup time < 5 minutes
- Zero credential exposure

#### 2. Intelligent Matching Engine
**Stealing from Competitors:**
- **From Numeric**: AI-powered transaction descriptions
- **From Ledge**: Pattern learning from past matches
- **From SolveXia**: Rule-based matching hierarchy

**Matching Logic Priority:**
```python
def match_transaction(stripe_payment, qb_invoices):
    # 1. Exact match (including fees)
    if exact_match := find_exact_with_fees(stripe_payment, qb_invoices):
        return MatchResult(exact_match, confidence=100)
    
    # 2. Customer + amount match
    if customer_match := find_customer_amount(stripe_payment, qb_invoices):
        return MatchResult(customer_match, confidence=95)
    
    # 3. Pattern-based match (learned)
    if pattern_match := ml_pattern_match(stripe_payment, qb_invoices):
        return MatchResult(pattern_match, confidence=85)
    
    # 4. Fuzzy match
    if fuzzy_match := fuzzy_match_all(stripe_payment, qb_invoices):
        return MatchResult(fuzzy_match, confidence=70)
    
    # 5. Queue for review
    return MatchResult(None, confidence=0, needs_review=True)
```

#### 3. Fee Handling (Critical Feature)
**Based on User Research:**
- Automatic Stripe fee calculation (2.9% + 30¢)
- Separate fee expense entries in QuickBooks
- Support for custom fee structures
- International payment fee handling
- Fee reconciliation reports

**Implementation:**
```python
class FeeProcessor:
    def process_stripe_payment(self, payment):
        gross_amount = payment.amount
        stripe_fee = (gross_amount * 0.029) + 0.30
        net_amount = gross_amount - stripe_fee
        
        return {
            'gross': gross_amount,
            'fee': stripe_fee,
            'net': net_amount,
            'fee_category': 'Payment Processing Fees'
        }
```

#### 4. Reconciliation Dashboard
**Core Views:**
- **Overview**: Matched, pending, exceptions
- **Review Queue**: Medium confidence matches for approval
- **Exception Handler**: Unmatched transactions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions

**Key Metrics Display:**
- Time saved this week/month
- Match accuracy rate
- Transactions processed
- Dollar value reconciled

### Phase 2 Features (Weeks 5-8)

#### 5. Pattern Learning System
**Inspired by Ledge:**
```python
class PatternLearner:
    def learn_from_match(self, payment, invoice, user_action):
        pattern = {
            'customer_id': payment.customer,
            'typical_amount': payment.amount,
            'day_of_month': payment.created.day,
            'invoice_pattern': invoice.number,
            'description_keywords': extract_keywords(invoice.description)
        }
        self.patterns.add(pattern)
        self.confidence_boost[pattern.customer_id] += 5
```

#### 6. Bulk Operations
**For High-Volume Users:**
- Bulk approve/reject matches
