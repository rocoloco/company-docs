# Mobius One Product Requirements Document (PRD)

*Last updated: June 24, 2025*

## Overview

### Product Name
Mobius One - The AI Interface Layer for Enterprise Systems

### Product Description
A conversational AI platform that unifies enterprise software systems, enabling business users to query and act across all their tools using natural language.

### Problem Statement
Enterprise companies use an average of 170+ different software systems that operate in silos. Business users, especially CFOs and RevOps managers, struggle to get answers to critical questions that span multiple systems, leading to:
- Hours or days to compile cross-system reports
- Revenue leakage from untracked deals
- Inefficient manual data reconciliation
- Decision-making based on incomplete information

### Solution
Mobius One provides a unified conversational interface that:
1. Connects to all enterprise systems through pre-built integrations
2. Understands natural language business queries
3. Routes queries to appropriate systems intelligently
4. Aggregates and presents results with source attribution
5. Suggests actionable next steps
