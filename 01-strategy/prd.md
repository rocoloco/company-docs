# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Mobius 1: Multi-Channel Payment Reconciliation Platform

**Version:** 4.0  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Launch Beta Testing

-----

## Executive Summary

SMBs waste 60 hours monthly reconciling payments from multiple channels. Mobius 1 automates this entire process, reducing reconciliation to 5 minutes. We automatically match bank deposits to payment processor payouts (Stripe, Amazon, Shopify) and sync everything to QuickBooks with fees properly separated.

### Current Reality

- **Customers:** 10 beta testers (pre-launch)
- **Product Status:** Core matching engine built and working (92% accuracy)
- **Revenue:** $0 MRR (launching January 2026)
- **Timeline:** 12 months to 150 customers and seed funding
- **Market Validation:** Ledge.io's NEA funding and Papaya Global deployment proves demand

### The Validated Problem

**PwC research documents the burden:**

- **60 hours monthly** for businesses with 1,000 transactions
- **200 hours monthly** for businesses with 10,000 transactions
- **0.8-1.8% error rate** in manual reconciliation
- **20 hours weekly** lost to multi-channel data reconciliation (Webgility)
- **90% time reduction** achieved by Papaya Global using automation (Ledge.io case study)

### Solution: 5-Minute Reconciliation

Multi-channel payment reconciliation that:

- Automatically matches bank deposits to payment processor payouts
- Breaks down payouts into individual transactions
- Syncs to QuickBooks with fees properly separated
- Flags discrepancies for investigation
- **Delivers in 5 minutes what Ledge.io delivers in weeks**

### Launch Timeline

- **January 2026:** Launch with Stripe only (5 customers)
- **April 2026:** Add second channel (40 customers, $12K MRR)
- **December 2026:** Full platform (150 customers, $55K MRR)

-----

## Problem Statement

### The Multi-Channel Reconciliation Nightmare

Mid-market e-commerce businesses processing payments through multiple channels face an exponential reconciliation burden:

**Current Process (60+ hours monthly):**

1. Export bank statements
2. Export Stripe payouts
3. Export Amazon settlement reports
4. Export Shopify payouts
5. Manually match deposits to payouts in Excel
6. Break down bulk payouts into individual transactions
7. Separate fees for proper categorization
8. Create QuickBooks journal entries
9. Investigate and resolve discrepancies
10. Maintain audit trail for compliance

**Why Current Solutions Fail:**

- **QuickBooks:** Can't match deposits to payment processor payouts
- **A2X/Synder:** Single channel only, still require manual bank matching
- **Ledge.io:** Enterprise-focused, weeks of implementation, opaque pricing, AI black box
- **BlackLine:** $6,400/month enterprise overkill
- **Manual/Excel:** Error-prone, no audit trail, doesn't scale

### Target Customer Profile

**Primary: Shopify Plus Stores (Our Sweet Spot)**

- **Revenue:** $3-10M annually
- **Payment Mix:** Stripe (primary) + PayPal/Amazon (secondary)
- **Transaction Volume:** 500-5,000 monthly
- **Current Solution:** Excel or partial automation
- **Pain:** "We spend 3 days every month just matching deposits"
- **Budget:** $300-1,000/month for financial tools
- **Why Not Ledge:** Too small for their enterprise approach

**Secondary: Multi-Channel E-commerce**

- **Revenue:** $5-20M annually
- **Channels:** Direct site + Amazon + retail/wholesale
- **Pain:** "Can't reconcile across all our payment channels"
- **Trigger:** Month-end close taking 5+ days
- **Why Not Ledge:** Don't need AI complexity, want transparent pricing

### What We're NOT

- **Not Enterprise Software:** We're built for SMBs

-----

## Conclusion

Mobius 1 solves a validated, quantified problem that costs SMBs 60+ hours monthly. Our multi-channel reconciliation platform delivers immediate time savings with simple, transparent pricing and 5-minute setup. 

While Ledge.io validates the market with enterprise deployments, they've left 55,000 SMBs underserved with their complex implementation and opaque pricing. We're positioned to own the SMB segment with a product built specifically for their needs.

With a realistic growth path to 150 customers and $55K MRR by December 2026, we're building the reconciliation platform that SMBs actually want: simple, transparent, and powerful.

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete beta testing (December 2025)
2. Launch with Stripe (January 2026)
3. Achieve product-market fit (Q1 2026)
4. Scale to 150 customers (December 2026)
5. Own the SMB reconciliation market
